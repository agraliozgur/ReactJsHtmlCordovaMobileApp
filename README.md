## ReactJsHtmlCordovaMobileApp is a croaa-platform(for from web-to-mobile apps)


It is now very easy to turn our web applications into a mobile appliation with ApacheCordova(PhoneGap).

I solved all of issues about programs relases. You can use this as it is by writing the necessary web source codes.
This is just a general draft hybrid mobile app study.

You can just HTML/CSS/JS website html put in the "www" folder for run. And For ReactJs website template you can put your src files in the "src" file.

 I am waiting for your comments and suggestions on this subject.
